# Roleplay Dice

Turns your micro:bit into a roleplaying dice, from D2 up to D25!

## Installation

Use the micro:bit python compiler (http://python.microbit.org/editor.html) to compile the .py into a .hex; drag and drop this into your micro:bit and go!

## Usage

Use the A/B buttons to decrease/increase the number of sides on the die, respectively, then shake to roll. You can shake the micro:bit again to roll the same die, or push the buttons to change the number of sides.
